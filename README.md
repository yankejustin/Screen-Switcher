# Screen-Switcher
Screen Switcher is an application using Windows Forms (written in C#) that makes changing the monitor of a program simple.

# Purpose
After running into problems with managing my multi-monitor setup, I began writing a little program to make managing different programs easier.

# To-Do
1. Save monitor positions
2. Add to start-up
3. Non-administrator updating of window program detection
