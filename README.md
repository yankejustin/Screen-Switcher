# Screen-Switcher
Screen Switcher is an application using Windows Forms (written in C#) that makes changing the monitor placement of a program simple.

# Purpose
After running into problems with managing programs on my multi-monitor setup, I wrote a basic program to make managing the monitor placement of the programs easier.

# To-Do
1. Save monitor positions
2. Add to start-up
3. Non-administrator updating of program detection
4. Allow settings such as <i>borderless</i> or to fill the program bar at the bottom of the screen.
